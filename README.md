# 🚀 Cost-Efficient AI Development Platform Using Spot Instances

## 스팟 인스턴스를 활용한 비용 효율적인 AI 개발 플랫폼


Callisto is an open-source platform that combines **serverless computing** and **spot instances** to provide a highly cost-effective AI development environment. It automatically provisions and terminates resources, supports secure authentication, and minimizes idle resource costs — ideal for research, education, and lightweight production use cases.

Callisto는 **서버리스 컴퓨팅**과 **스팟 인스턴스**를 결합하여 비용 효율적인 AI 개발 환경을 제공하는 오픈소스 플랫폼입니다. 자원을 자동으로 생성·회수하고, 안전한 인증을 지원하며, 유휴 리소스의 비용을 최소화합니다.

## ✨ Features  

- 🔐 **Serverless authentication with JWT**  
  Stateless, secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).


- ☁️ **Dynamic spot instance provisioning**  
  Uses AWS `price-capacity-optimized` strategy to launch cost-effective and stable spot instances.

- 💤 **Idle session auto-termination**  
  Automatically shuts down unused environments to prevent unnecessary charges.

- 📉 **Verified cost savings**  
  Up to 77.44% reduction in real-world classroom deployments.
